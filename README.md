Project Title: CRIME RATE PREDICTION AND ANALYSIS USING STACKED GENERALIZATION TECHNIQUE

Description:
Crime is one of the biggest and dominating problems in our society, and its prevention plays a crucial role in the betterment of lives. It is very important to identify different factors, occurrence relations, and triggering events of crimes to determine the methodologies required to reduce crime rates. Several prediction-based theories have been proposed to handle machine learning crime prediction problems. This project produces an efficient model using stack-based crime prediction methods for identifying the appropriate prediction methods. An ensemble approach is used here. The ensemble model outperforms the others with the highest coefficient of correlation, which has the lowest average and absolute errors. The model is found to produce a more predictive effect than the previous research taken as baselines, focusing solely on the  crime dataset based on violence. The stacked ensemble (hybrid ensemble) model combines the predictions of various machine learning models such as K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Decision Trees (DT), and Random Forest (RF), using a simple model, such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed approach was also found to be useful for suggesting that the prediction accuracy of the stacking ensemble model is higher than that of the individual classifier.

Proposed Work
The proposed system uses the Ensemble Model to predict the accuracy, as shown in the Proposed Diagram. The Ensemble Model means the preparation of combined machine learning algorithms that produce better   accuracy. To identify and examine the nature of crime investigation of computer research and  building crime rate prediction models by applying simple and aggregate machine learning to estimate the crime rate, predetermined factors of crime. In this, we are going to use the Decision Tree(J48), Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and KNN algorithms, and then implement the Ensemble Model by using SVM as meta model. Then we compare all the algorithms that are implemented and show that the Ensemble Model produces better accuracy.

An ensemble model is created by combining several machine learning methods to increase accuracy. By using simple and aggregate machine learning to estimate the crime rate and present determinants of crime, it is possible to identify and investigate the nature of crime through computer research and the construction of crime rate prediction analysis.
The Decision Tree (J48), Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and KNN algorithms will be used in this, and the Ensemble Model will be implemented utilizing SVM as a meta model. The Ensemble Model produces the best accuracy, as demonstrated by a comparison of all the implemented methods.
